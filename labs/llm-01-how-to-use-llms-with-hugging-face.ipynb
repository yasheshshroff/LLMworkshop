The goal is to generate a high probability sequence of tokens, which is essentially a search through the (enormous) space of potential sequences.\n\nTo do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n   * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search.\n   * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n   * **Top-K sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n   * **Top-p sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n\nYou can toggle between search and sampling via parameter `do_sample`.\n\nFor more background on search and sampling, see [this Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\n\nWe will illustrate these various options below using our summarization pipeline.","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"e8428997-8cf5-48fb-af0a-f95785d54da3","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We previously called the summarization pipeline using the default inference configuration.\n# This does greedy search.\nsummarizer(xsum_sample[\"document\"][0])","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"5f54ec3d-b5b6-4b2e-8b1e-95bc89020d83","inputWidgets":{},"title":""},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T15:13:04.983266Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T15:13:04.983711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T15:13:06.694212Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T15:13:04.983676Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T15:13:06.693056Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We can instead do a beam search by specifying num_beams.\n# This takes longer to run, but it might find a better (more likely) sequence of text.\nsummarizer(xsum_sample[\"document\"][0], num_beams=10)","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"21a66b7b-60f3-4cfc-b48d-873bd960e121","inputWidgets":{},"title":""},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T15:13:08.98171Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T15:13:08.982302Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T15:13:12.32409Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T15:13:08.982255Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T15:13:12.323004Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Alternatively, we could use sampling.\nsummarizer(xsum_sample[\"document\"][0], do_sample=True)","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"45e6222f-8934-49bb-b174-d9ef0715c181","inputWidgets":{},"title":""},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T15:13:24.920913Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T15:13:24.921422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T15:13:26.700087Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T15:13:24.921387Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T15:13:26.698756Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We can modify sampling to be more greedy by limiting sampling to the top_k or top_p most likely next tokens.\nsummarizer(xsum_sample[\"document\"][0], do_sample=True, top_k=10, top_p=0.8)","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"c3ee68e5-0aed-4aba-90cf-3fbc1b4e85a9","inputWidgets":{},"title":""},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T15:13:34.280703Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T15:13:34.281488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T15:13:36.311488Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T15:13:34.281434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T15:13:36.310253Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Auto* loaders for tokenizers and models\n\nWe have already seen the `dataset` and `pipeline` abstractions from Hugging Face.

Summary\n\nWe've covered some common LLM applications and seen how to get started with them quickly using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub.  We've also see how to tweak some configurations.\n\nBut how did we find those models for our tasks?  In the lab, you will find new pre-trained models for tasks, using the Hugging Face Hub.  You will also explore tweaking model configurations to gain intuition about their effects.","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"5deaf8c7-eaed-4931-9f28-2191a1bdb515","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"&copy; 2023 Databricks, Inc.
